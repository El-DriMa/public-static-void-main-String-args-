# Java Syntax Tutorial

This project is a tutorial created using materials from learnjavaonline.org

I used this resource to learn the basics of Java syntax, including variables, control structures, classes, methods, arrays, and exception handling.

It serves as a practical example of my progress in understanding Java programming.
